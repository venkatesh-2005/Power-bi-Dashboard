✨ Power BI Project – Andhra Pradesh Tribal Population Dashboard ✨
I’m excited to share my latest Power BI dashboard, built using the Andhra Pradesh Tribal Population dataset. This project focuses on understanding demographic distribution, population patterns, and community insights across the tribal regions of Andhra Pradesh.
📊 What this dashboard reveals:
 ✔️ District-wise tribal population distribution
 ✔️ Comparison of major tribal communities
 ✔️ Percentage share of tribal population across districts
 ✔️ Growth, density, and demographic patterns
 ✔️ Clean and interactive visuals for easy interpretation
🛠️ Tech Stack Used:
 ▪ Power BI
 ▪ DAX
 ▪ Data Cleaning & Modelling
 ▪ Interactive charts, maps & drill-downs
🚀 What I learned:
 This project enhanced my skills in analytical storytelling, population data interpretation, and dashboard UI/UX. It also strengthened my understanding of how BI tools can be used to support policy planning, welfare programs, and socio-economic development.
💡 Why this project matters:
 Tribal population insights are crucial for shaping education, healthcare, and development initiatives. This dashboard helps present these metrics in a visual format that decision-makers can use to take action.
Excited to continue building meaningful dashboards and real-world data solutions!
